# Weather App

*NOTE: The project is currently suspended.*

App that allows a user to compare the weather in two different locations. Based on `Open Weather` API.

Main app features:
- adding favorite locations (based on geolocation service provided by Open Weather)
- comparing the weather between two favorite locations (day and night temperature, day length, sunrise, sunset etc.)
- displaying weather differences between locations (colder, shorter, sooner...)
- displaying cached data when network connection is not available

Written in `Flutter`, uses `Riverpod` as a state management solution.
